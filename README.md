# DronePan Android App for 3DR Solo
This is an initial version of DronePan for Solo. Please be sure to review the notes below before getting started.

## Notes
* DronePan for Solo will automatically put Solo in Guided flight mode so the Android app can issue yaw, photo, and gimbal commands to the aircraft. 

* DronePan currently takes 19 photos. 6 photos at each of the gimbal angles 0, -30, -60 and then one final nadir shot at -90 degrees. (We're new to the GoPro Hero 4 so it may be feasible to a get full pano with less photos)

* When your panorama is complete you'll see a message and then Solo will be automatically switched into Altitude Hold mode. Be prepared to take control of your Solo. We're looking into switching into Solo's "Fly" mode, but are uncertain what that is. Perhaps it's Position Hold mode?

* Always be prepared to switch out of Guided mode in case you experience any weird behavior. Have your A & B buttons setup to toggle into whatever flight mode you feel comfortable with. Then you can take control of Solo.
