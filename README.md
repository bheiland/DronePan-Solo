# DronePan Android App for 3DR Solo
This is an initial version of DronePan for Solo. Please be sure to review the notes below before getting started.

## Notes
* DronePan for Solo will automatically put Solo in Guided flight mode so the Android app can issue yaw, photo, and gimbal commands to the aircraft. 

* DronePan currently takes 19 photos. 6 photos at each of the gimbal angles 0, -30, -60 and then one final nadir shot at -90 degrees. (We're new to the GoPro Hero 4 so it may be feasible to a get full pano with less photos)

* When your panorama is complete you'll see a message and then Solo will be automatically switched back to FLY mode (aka Loiter). Be prepared to take control of your Solo.

* Always be prepared to switch out of Guided mode in case you experience any weird behavior. Have your A & B buttons setup to toggle into whatever flight mode you feel comfortable with. Then you can take control of Solo.
